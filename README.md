    My name is Nelson A. Barrientos, 20 years old. Residing in Taloot,Argao, Cebu.
I’m a Senior High graduate for Academic Strand Elective in Biology.I have been 
trained intensively by the Department of Information and Communications Technology 
under their Digital Jobs Training Program for Virtual Assistance Courses such as 
Digital Marketing, Graphic Designing, Customer Relationship Management and many more.

There are three factors that would describe myself: one is being individualist, 
being patient and last is being focused. 

    Being an individualist helps me to take 
decisions and actions independently, having self reliance and self sufficiency. 
I’m able to work with projects without the help of others because I feel 
conscious and unsatisfied with my work unless it’s needed in a working environment.

    Being patient to achieve goals, especially big goals, and this requires patience. 
If we are too impatient, desiring to have immediate results, we might be 
disappointed and quit our goals. Aside from studying to improve ourselves, we 
should set ourselves clear visions and are timely relevant towards our goals.

    Last is being focused, I remind myself of my ultimate goals. Creating a vision board, 
a mind movie, or some system that serves as a constant reminder of what Im working 
toward. I always visualize this goal and put into details to be better and serves 
with quality.
    
    I am a freelancer and my working ground is based on information technology. 
Like, it could be digital marketing such as live chat support, graphic designing 
using Canva and other online freelancing sections. I can do anything that is 
related to my job. Also I have a handful of experiences on this ground.

    I am acquainted enough with the skills that your job demands and these are web
research, data entry, audio and video transcription, live chat support, appointment 
scheduler and many more. Also I am a scholar of the DICT ( Department of Information 
and Communication Technology) program on Virtual Assistance as a freelancer. Along 
with these, I am adept enough to make Graphic Design using Canva and Digital Marketing 
in live chat support.

    I’m  dedicated to caretaking you with precise and methodical service. I'm rigorously 
scheduled and organized. You can expect definitive maintenance calendars and detailed 
communications. I’m as efficient with your energy and your expenditures as I’m with 
myself. Rest easy. I’m on watch.”

Immense organizing skills.
100% assurance of making clients happy.
Meeting management and reaping good results out of it.
